#1.Getting started

The program aims to show the integration of the Python recursion function in Floyd's algorithm. The program has been created as part of a mid-module assessment for CSCK541 Software Development in Practice.

##Tool requirements and installation

For the purpose of this program, no specific tools are necessary. It has been created in Visual Studio Code for Mac and then implemented with Visual Studio. The program can be used in IDLE and other terminals that support Python language.

#Development

The project has been created following Floyd's algorithm code provided below.

	def floyd(distance):
	"""
	A simple implementation of Floyd's algorithm
	"""
	for intermediate, start_node,end_node\
	in itertools.product\
	(range(MAX_LENGTH),range(MAX_LENGTH), range(MAX_LENGTH)):
	#Assume that if start_node and end_node are the same
	#then the distance would be zero
	if start_node == end_node:
	distance[start_node][end_node] = 0
	continue
	#return all possible paths and find the minimum
	distance[start_node][end_node] = min(distance[start_node][end_node],
	distance[start_node][intermediate] + distance[intermediate][end_node] )
	#Any value that have sys.maxsize has no path
	print (distance)
	floyd(graph)

To include the recurtion function additional lines have been included, the GIT repository contains the first two graph and the final version of the document, which reports the following code

	def floyd_warshall(distance, n, k):
   	#  Implements Floyd's algorithm recursively to find 	shortest paths.


	for i in range(n):
     for j in range(n):
        if distance[i][k] + distance[k][j] < distance[i][j]:
            distance[i][j] = distance[i][k] + distance[k][j]
                
    if k == n - 1:
        return distance
	  else:
        return floyd_warshall(distance, n, k + 1)

	#Example usage
	dist = [[0, 3, float("inf"), 7],
        [float("inf", 0, 4, 1],
        [float("inf)", float("inf"), 0, 5],
        [float("inf", float("inf"), float("inf"), 0]]

	result = floyd_warshall(dist, len(dist), 0)

	print(result)  # Output: [[0 3 7 1], [INF 0 4 1], [INF INF 0 5], [INF INF INF 0]]

#Additional consideration

This is the first time that I have written a code and the first time that I have used GitHub, I am very excited, and I hope the code works well.

Thank you ðŸ˜Š
